    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    
    <p>
        I've always been fascinated by technology and the way it shapes our world. Becoming a software developer allows me to turn ideas into real-world solutions and solve problems creatively. 
        I enjoy learning new programming languages, building applications, and continuously improving my skills. 
        The ability to create tools that help people and make everyday life easier is a huge motivation for me.
